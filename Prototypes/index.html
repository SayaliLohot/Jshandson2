<h3>Q.1 Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child object using parents prototype</h3>
<pre>
    const parent ={
    details(){
        console.log(`My name is ${this.name} and I am from ${this.location} and my age is ${this.age}`)
    }
    }
    const firstchild = Object.create(parent);
    firstchild.name ="Sayali";
    firstchild.location="Maharashtra";
    firstchild.age= 23;
    
    firstchild.details();
    
    const secondChild= Object.create(parent)
    secondChild.name="Shruti"
    secondChild.location="Pune"
    secondChild.age="22"
    
    secondChild.details()</pre>
    <b>My name is Sayali and I am from Maharashtra and my age is 23<br>
       My name is Shruti and I am from Pune and my age is 22</b>

<h3>Q.2 Write code to explain prototype chaining</h3>
<pre>
const grandFather={
    name:"Sudhir",
    age:80
   }
const father=Object.create(grandFather)
console.log(father.name)//it will gives result as sudhir as name property is not to fater hence it will look for it in parent chain
const son = Object.create(grandFather)
son.name="Yogesh"
console.log(son.name)//as we declase value of son.name hence it shows resullt as yogesh</pre>
<b>Output-Sudhir<br>
    Yogesh</b>
<h3>Q.3 Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to calculate sum for multiple arrays</h3>
<pre>
let arr = new Array(1,2,3,4,5)
    arr.__proto__.sum=function(givenArray){
        let count = 0;
        for(let i =0;i< arr.length;i++){
            count +=arr[i];
        }
        return count;
    }
    let result =arr.sum(arr)
    console.log(result)</pre>
    <b>Output - The sum of given array's element is  15 </b>
<h3>Q.4 Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited properties.</h3>
